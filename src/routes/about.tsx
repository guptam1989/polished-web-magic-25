              The Department of Computer Science and Engineering began in 1990 with an intake of 40
              students in its undergraduate programme, later revised to 60 and now 93. Postgraduate
              and Ph.D. programmes were introduced in 2006. The department's research spans
              artificial intelligence, security, networks, software engineering and high-performance
              computing.

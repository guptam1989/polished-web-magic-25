The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` automatically builds and
publishes the website whenever a commit is pushed to `main`.

In the GitHub repository, open **Settings > Pages** and set **Source** to
**GitHub Actions**. Then open the **Actions** tab and run **Deploy website to
GitHub Pages**, or push a new commit to `main`.

The published website URL is:
